        <p>The Database of Canada’s Early Women Writers (DoCEWW) at Simon Fraser
            University is associated with the larger Canada’s Early Women Writers
            (CEWW) project, which is part of the <a href="http://www.cwrc.ca/en/">Canadian 
                Writing Research Collaboratory (CWRC)</a>. Both projects include
            women authors who either lived for an extensive period of time in Canada
            or self-identified as Canadian, and who published some form of writing
            in English—in any genre and in any forum—up to and including 1950.</p>

        <p>Whereas CEWW offers extensive bio-bibliographic entries on a selection
            of early Canadian women writers for whom sufficient information can be
            found, the DoCEWW is a simpler, easily navigable database of all
            Canadian women writers who have been identified by our project.</p>

        <p>Whenever the information is available, the DoCEWW records each author’s
            name, alternative names, dates and places of birth and death,
            residences, titles written, and collections and periodicals contributed
            to. While the DoCEWW already contains some 4500 authors, the list is not
            yet not comprehensive, and we invite the public to contribute new names,
            or additional information about the women we already have listed.</p>

            individual author or title, or leave a comment on the
